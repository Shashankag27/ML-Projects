# Marketing Campaign for Banking Products
Author: Shashank Agrawal

A bank has a growing customer base.
The bank wants to increase borrowers (asset customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on loans.
So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers. (while retaining them as depositors). 
A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. 
The department wants you to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.
